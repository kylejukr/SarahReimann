                    <p>Sarah is knowledgeable, empowering and motivates others to pursue their passions and achieve their goals. I have seen Sarah help start ups, young entrepreneurs, stagnant business owners with guidance and support needed to get on track with goal setting and increasing clientele. Sarah has been a powerful rock, providing constant support, encouragement and real life/business advice. Telling me truths, not necessarily what I want to hear. She is a listening ear through my struggles, with positive input and is a great example of a successful business person. One of the stand out qualities about Sarah, is her calm nature, bringing a quiet assurance to her workshops (Ie not arrogant or me, me, me) and a belief in others.</p>

                    <p>I was fortunate to meet Sarah Reimann at an accounting networking event in May 2017. I have since attended a dinner where Sarah was the presenter and found her presentation informative and inspirational. Sarah is personable and professional as an Accountant and public speaker and is also a dedicated business owner. It is evident Sarah is passionate in assisting other business owners to face their challenges and grow their businesses using her career and life experiences.</p>

                    <p>Sarah is passionate, self-driven and extremely knowledgeable about how to balance life, money and health. Dealing with people’s money as an accountant for many years, she saw the one-dimensional area of life that she was dealing with and further developed her skills holistically understanding that finances are only one part of the puzzle for a fulfilled and happy/healthy life. This shines through in her presentations and having known Sarah personally for 10 years, she most certainly practices what she preaches. I have been involved with Sarah as a tax accountant, as a business motivator and as a friend and admire her approach to all aspects of her life - simplicity, honesty and motivating.</p>
                    <p>Sarah keeps it real and comes highly recommended to those who want guidance on how to balance life through finance, mental strength, organisation and lifestyle.</p>

                    <p>Sarah believes accounting can be fun beyond the legal obligations. Her approach focuses on the positive potential of accounts-keeping as a valuable information tool towards growing the business. As I am a self-employed person who has long seen accounts-keeping as a necessary evil. I felt Sarah’s warm and engaging approach to questions and discussions during the workshop helped me greatly. I am going to take a new approach to incorporating my accounting requirements into my business development portfolio.</p>

                    <p>I have attended a business workshop run by Sarah and she has been my accountant for several years now. Sarah has always provided honest, reliable, practical information which has served me well in my business and I am confident the information she provides is up to date. For anyone looking to streamline their business (or completely revamp their structure and processes like I did), I would highly recommend Sarah. I was seriously struggling with keeping up with my administration for my business and Sarah organised my business structure, administrative processes and has saved me an enormous amount of time a year - which translates into much less stress, worry and given me some much-needed time freedom. I was looking to get sorted out and Sarah has certainly done this for me. I have also attended a business workshop which was invaluable in providing the time to think about other things of importance in my life that I have been neglecting, with an action plan and resources to sort these out. Go see Sarah and get yourself sorted out!</p>

                    <p>I have known Sarah for several years and she has been a returning student to my yoga classes. in 2017 I attended one of her small business basic workshops at Equity Flare and got so much out of it! I would recommend it to any small business owner wanting to get a handle on the ins and outs of the financing and budgets of their business. I am looking forward to working with Sarah further in the future.</p>

                    <p>I came to Sarah's accounting firm when I was experiencing some major life changes. She calmly and professionally sorted everything out for me, educated me on my options, supported me in my decisions and alleviated my concerns with her expert knowledge. I knew then I had found a trusted professional who took the time to get to know me and my needs and adjusted her support to reflect this knowledge.</p>
                    <p>Not only has she proved to be an honest, enlightened professional, she has also been a pillar of support in every aspect of my business and financial life. Thankfully, she knows that to be successful and happy, you need to look at health, wealth, relationships and business altogether, and this she excels at. Sarah's sensitivity and ability to empathise ensures that she looks at your issues from your point of view, and through this offers solutions to challenges that work within the parameters of yourself, your life and your business. As she adjusts her life to make room for her coaching passion, I offer up recommendations to all.</p>
                    <p>If you would like supportive, knowledgeable business coaching, and if an opportunity to be supported by Sarah presents itself - take it. I know that I will.</p>
